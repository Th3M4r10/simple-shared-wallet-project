### The entire work flow as follows :

- Admin deploys a smart contract that acts as a shared wallet
- Admin funds the wallet with some ETH, this will be the walletâ€™s total balance
- Admin authorises certain wallet addresses to spend a certain amount of ETH from the wallet within a certain time limit
- Finally, the users can spend the ETH within their allowance and time limit, as set by the admin
